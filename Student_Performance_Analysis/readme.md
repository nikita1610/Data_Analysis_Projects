## by Nikita Jain

## Dataset
> This dataset is taken from Kaggle from link :https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
 This dataset contains information about the marks scored by students in United States in various subjects such as maths,reading and writing Scores along 
 with other features such as
 1. Race/Ethinicty
 2. Gender
 3. Parent Education
 4. lunch
 5. test preparation course
 
 Dataset was anaylsed and various columns were renamed for easier understanding and various new features were also incorporated such as :
 1. Total Score of each student
 2. Percentage of each student
 3. Pass/Fail result of each student.
 
## Summary of Findings

> In this phase of anaylsis various categorical and quantitative variables were anaylsed and their distribution was studied. Firstly each feature was 
studied indivdually and then two features were taken along and observed and then relationship between 3 features was taken into account. The major observations are 
listed below: 
1.Male gender tends to perform better in subject maths and female gender tends to perform better in other subjects.  

2. Group E students tend to perform better in all subjects as compared to other groups and Group A students performance 
is the lowest among all other groups. 

3. Out of 1000 students only 15 students have failed making the fail percentage as 1.5% and pass percentage 98.5%.

4. Test Preparation course also plays a major role in deciding the result of the student.Every student who has ompleted the test preparation course 
have passed in all subjects. All those students have failed who have not taken the test preparation course.  
    
5. Parent education can also be considered as an important criteria in determining the results of the students.              
Students whose parents have completed master's or bachleor's degree have not failed in any subject. Lowest pass percentage is recorded by students 
whose parents have just gone to some high school. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

>Total Score and percentage by result and parental education
It was visualised from the drawn plot that students whose parents have completed masters/bachelors degree in education have not failed in examinations 
and highest total score is obtained by students whose parents have completed master's degree followed by students whose parents have completed 
bachelors degree . Lowest total score and percentage have been recorded by students whose parents have gone to some high school or just completed high school.

>Average Scores by test preparation course and Pass/Fail Result
As it was visualised from the plot that no student that have completed the test preparation course has failed. Only those have failed 
in their examinations who didn't take up test preparation course. The test preparation course seemed to be an deciding factor in determining the result 
of the student.It can also be noted that students who have taken the test preparation course tend to have scored higher marks in all subjects.
